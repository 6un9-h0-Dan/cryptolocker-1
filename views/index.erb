<h1>There is nothing much to see here.</h1>

<p>
  You can <strong>PUT</strong> new content here via the
  <a href="<%= url("/submit") %>">API end point</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If a file was pushed here, you should have a link to it, and that link will
  ask you for your username and password.
</p>

<h2>Normal Users <%= "(that's you, that it)" if logged_in? and not admin? %></h2>
<p>
  There is not a huge amount of stuff you can do here apart from 
  <a href="<%= url("/secure/users") %>">changing your password</a>.
  Sorry about that.
</p>

<h2>Admin User <%= "(that's you, that it)" if admin? %></h2>
<p>
  If you're the admin user, you also have the ability to download a copy of
  <a href="<%= url("/secure/private-key") %>">the private key</a>
  (If you do this, keep it VERY secure. It's the lynchpin that's keeping all
  the data secure).
  Or you can <a href="<%= url("/secure/users") %>">manage other users</a>.
